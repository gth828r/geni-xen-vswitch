This is a set of libraries, scripts, and modifications that can
be used to provision vSwitches for GENI experiments such that
both experimenter-controlled OpenFlow experiments can be run
alongside experiments that just use standard VLANs.

Note that these scripts were developed using an Ubuntu 12.04
image running Xen 4.1.
